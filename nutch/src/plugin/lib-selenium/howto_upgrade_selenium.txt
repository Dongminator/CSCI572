1. Upgrade various driver versions dependency in src/plugin/lib-selenium/ivy.xml

2. Upgrade Selenium's own dependencies in src/plugin/lib-selenium/plugin.xml

   To get a list of dependencies and their versions execute:
    $ ant -f ./build-ivy.xml
    $ ls lib | sed 's/^/     <library name="/g' | sed 's/$/">\n       <export name="*"\/>\n     <\/library>/g'

   Note that all dependent libraries are exported for a "library" plugin ("lib-selenium").
